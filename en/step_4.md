## Do sums

In Python, you can work with numbers and dates. You can use arithmetic operators to do sums:

| + | add |   
| - | subtract |   
| * | multiply |   
| / | divide |   
| ** | to the power |   

### Create a calculation

--- task ---

Add two more `print()` lines to your code including a sum for Python to do:

**Tip:** To get an `*` symbol, press the <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>8</kbd> keys at the same time.

language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 19
line_highlights: 21-22

print('Hello', world)
print('Welcome to', python)
print(python, 'is very good at maths!')
print(230 * 5782 ** 2 / 23781)  # Print the result of the sum

title: Comments

Sentences beginning with `#` are **comments**. You do not need to type the comments â€” they are just there to help you understand the code.

**Test:** Run your code. Python will do the sum and ouput the result.

**Debug:**

title: I have a syntax error

Make sure you have added a comma `,` between the items in `print()` and you have spelled `python` correctly.
