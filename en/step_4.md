## Calculating sums

In Python you can work with numbers and dates. You can use maths operators to do sums:

| + | add |   
| - | subtract |   
| * | multiply |   
| / | divide |   
| ** | to the power |   

### Create a calculation

--- task ---

Add another two `print()` lines to your code including a sum for Python to calculate:

**Tip:** To get a `*` symbol press <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>8</kbd> at the same time.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 18
line_highlights: 20-21
---

print('Hello', world)   
print('Welcome to', python)   
print(python, 'is very good at maths!')   
print(230 * 5782 ** 2 / 23781)  # Print the result of the sum

title: Tip on using comments
---

Lines beginning with a `#` are <span style="color: #0faeb0">**comments**</span>. You don't need to type the comments, they are just there to help you understand the code. Just type the code before the `#`.

**Test:** Run your code. You should see the sums calculated and output.

**Debug:**

title: I have a syntax error

Make sure that you have added a comma `,` between the items in `print()` and that you have spelled `python` correctly.
