## Sums and dates

In Python you can use maths operators to do sums:

| + | add |   
| - | subtract |   
| * | multiply |   
| / | divide |   
| ** | to the power |   

### Create a calculation

--- task ---

Add another two `print()` lines to your code including a sum for Python to work out:

**Tip:** To get a `*` symbol press <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>8</kbd> at the same time.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 18
line_highlights: 20-21
---

print('Hello', world)   
print('Welcome to', python)   
print(python, 'is very good at maths!')   
print(230 * 5782 ** 2 / 23781)  # Print the result of the sum

--- /code ---

**Tip:** You don't need to type the comments, they are just there to help you understand the code. Just type the code before the `#`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code. Did Python calculate the sum correctly? Only joking! Python does the hard maths for you so you don't need to work it out.

**Debug:**

title: I have a syntax error

Make sure that you have added a comma `,` between the items in `print()` and that you have spelled `python` correctly.

Japanese computer scientist <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Emma Haruka Iwao**</span> used a computer to calculate the value of Pi (*Ï€*) to 31 trillion digits. That answer is so long that it would take over 300,000 years just to say it!

Try changing the sum that Python does to a complicated one!

You can also use brackets if you want to control the order that Python calculates the sum: `print( (2 + 4) * (5 + 3) )`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code and get Python to calculate your sum.

**Debug:** Make sure your sum has a left and right round bracket around it `( 2 * 45 )`. If you use extra brackets to control the order, make sure you have a right bracket to match every left bracket.

On the code editor, you might find the text too big or too small to read. You can easily change these settings to suit your preference. 

**Tip:** Click on the **Settings menu** (the icon next to the Save button) in the top-right of your code editor. Then click on any of the **Text Size** buttons to change the size of the text.

You can also switch between colour modes, click on the **Light & Dark** buttons to see the changes.

The line `from datetime import *` at the top of the **main.py** tab includes a library with helpful functions for getting the current date and time.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
One of the great things about Python is all the <span style="color: #0faeb0">**libraries**</span> of code that are available to use. A Python library allows you to easily use code that other people have written. There are libraries for drawing charts and graphs, making art, doing calculations, and lots more.

Add another line to your code to `print` the current date and time.

Get the current date and time by using the `now()` function from the `datetime` library:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 20
line_highlights: 22
---

print(python, 'is very good at maths!')    
print(230 * 5782 ** 2 / 23781)  # Print the result of the sum     
print('The date and time is', datetime.now())  # Print the current date and time
 
--- /code ---

**Tip:** You don't need to type the comments, they are just there to help you understand the code. Just type the part before the `#`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code a couple of times to see the time update.

**Debug:** Check that you have a fullstop `.` between `datetime` and `now`. Check all the punctuation carefully.
