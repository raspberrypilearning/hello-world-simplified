If you are following the [Introduction to Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/python-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [Target practice](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/target-practice) project. In this project, you will draw a target then make an archery game that shoots arrows to score points.
