## Upgrade your project

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Add more to your project. There are more emojis to choose from.
  </div>
<div>

![A longer project in the output area with more text, emoji, and inputs.](images/upgrade_ideas.png){:width="300px"} 

</div>
</div>

You could:
+ Use `print` with different text and emojis
+ Use `input` to get values from the user and store them as variables, then do sums with the variables
+ Write more functions to organise your code
+ Use `#` to add comments to your code


[[[choose-an-emoji]]]

Here's an example function that asks about hobbies:

--- code ---
---
language: python
---

# Put code to run under here    
def hobbies():   
    hobby = input('What do you like?')   
    print('That sounds', fun)  # You will need to create an emoji variable called 'fun'
    print('You could make a', python, 'project about', hobby) 

--- /code ---

**Tip:** Remember to call your function as well as define it.

You can use `input` to make your project wait for the user to tap <kbd>Enter</kbd> at any point in this project.

--- code ---
---
language: python
---

roll_dice()

input()  # Wait for the user to tap Enter

hobbies()  # Calls the hobbies function
