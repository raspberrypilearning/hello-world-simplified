Add more `print` lines to your code. Here are some sentence starters that you can use:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 29
line_highlights: 30-32
---

roll_dice()  # Call the roll dice function
print('I ❤️ ...')   
print('... makes me 😃')   
print('I\'d like to make ... with', python)   

--- /code ---

**Tip:** Each use of `print` adds a line inbetween. 

**Tip:** If you need to print an apostrophe `'` then you need to put a backslash `\` before it so Python knows it's part of the text. 

**Tip:** Add a `#` at the beginning of a line to turn it into a comment.

What message would you send to a friend to cheer them up? Which emoji would you choose?

Scroll to the **emoji** section in the code editor to see the emojis and example variables that you can use. Copy the ones you choose and save them to a variable or add them directly to your code.

You can add more emojis to the **emoji** section. Use this [emoji list](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html){:target="_blank"} to find the ones you want.
