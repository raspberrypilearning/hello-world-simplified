That's correct. Calling this function will print `I can code`. You noticed that functions need brackets `(` `)` and a colon `:` in the function definition, and that all code to be run when that function is called must be indented.

 Not quite. The layout in this example would cause an error.

Not quite. There is something missing from the function definition that would cause an error.
