 No, this is the code to define the function, but it does not run the function. You'll need to use different code to call it.

Close! `two_dice` is the name of the function, but to call it you need more than just the name.

two_dice[]

 Not quite, think about they type of brackets you used to call the functions in your project.

two_dice()

 --- feedback ---

 That's correct, using the function name followed by `(` `)` brackets will call the function.
