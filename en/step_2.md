### Print Hello

In Python, `print()` outputs text (words or numbers) to the screen.

--- task ---

Find the line `# Put code to run under here`.

The flashing `|` is the cursor. It shows where you will type.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Type the code to `print()` Hello to the screen:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 18
line_highlights: 19
---

# Put code to run under here
print('Hello')

--- /code ---

When you type an opening bracket `(`, the Code Editor will automatically add a closing bracket `)`. This also happens when you type an opening quote `'`.

On a UK or US keyboard, the left `(` and right `)` round brackets are on the <kbd>9</kbd> and <kbd>0</kbd> keys. To type a left round bracket, hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key (next to <kbd>Z</kbd>) and press <kbd>9</kbd>.

The single quote `'` is on the same row as the <kbd>L</kbd> key.

The comma `,` is next to the <kbd>M</kbd> key.

If you get an error, check your code really carefully. Check there are single quotes around `Hello` so Python knows it is meant to be text.

![In the Code Editor, the code area contains the line print(Hello) with no single quotes, and the error "NameError: name 'Hello' is not defined on line 19 of main.py" is shown in the output area.](images/hello_error.png)
